You should reacquaint yourself with the [[howto:upload]] guide to make sure you understand the site rules.\n\nOver the next several weeks your approvals will be monitored. If the majority of them are not quality uploads you will fail the trial period and lose your approval privileges. You will also receive a negative user record indicating you previously attempted and failed a test janitor trial.\n\nThere is a minimum quota of 1 approval a month to indicate that you are being active. Remember, the goal isn't to approve as much as possible. It's to filter out borderline-quality art."
