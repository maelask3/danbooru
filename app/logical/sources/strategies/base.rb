# This is a collection of strategies for extracting information about a 
# resource. At a minimum it tries to extract the artist name and a canonical 
# URL to download the image from. But it can also be used to normalize a URL 
# for use with the artist finder. 
#
# Design Principles
#
# In general you should minimize state. You can safely assume that <tt>url</tt>
# and <tt>referer_url</tt> will not change over the lifetime of an instance,
# so you can safely memoize methods and their results. A common pattern is
# conditionally making an external API call and parsing its response. You should
# make this call on demand and memoize the response.

      #   downloading. This may sometimes point to the binary file. 
      #   It may also point to the artist's profile page, in cases
      #   where this class is being used to normalize artist urls.
      #   Implementations should be smart enough to detect this and 
      #   behave accordingly.
      # * <tt>referer_url</tt> - Sometimes the HTML page cannot be
      #   determined from <tt>url</tt>. You should generally pass in a
      #   <tt>referrer_url</tt> so the strategy can discover the HTML
      #   page and other information.
